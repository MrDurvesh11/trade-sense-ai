**TradeSense.AI Project README**

Welcome to the TradeSense.AI project! This project aims to provide users with insightful stock analysis and trading recommendations using artificial intelligence and data analytics. Below you'll find important information about the project setup and components.

### Project Overview:

TradeSense.AI combines the power of AI-generated insights with real-time financial data to assist users in making informed trading decisions. The project consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
2. **Backend**: Developed with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to interact with the Gemini API for stock analysis and recommendations.
3. **Database**: Utilizes a MySQL database stored in XAMPP to store user data and historical stock information.
4. **API**: The backend interacts with the database using a Next.js API to manage user authentication, data retrieval, and storage.
